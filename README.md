# AmongUS-Logbook
A little among us helper to help you log all the information you gain during the game.
This is still in really early access and since i'm not that good with python any help is really appriciated both with the code side and also possible new features. 

MAKE SURE YOU RUN THE CODE WITHOUT MOVING IT OUT OF IT'S FOLDER 

v 0.02
Fixed the buttor to remove colours that are not used. Added a win lose counter

v 0.01
Track cleared, suspicious and dead players. Add custom logs to players and view all the info. Clear button to reset all info after a game. Remove colours that are not used. Windows version stays always on  top
